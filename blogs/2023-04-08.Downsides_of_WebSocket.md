Let discuss some of the features (Good or Bad) of WebSocket:

### Ping-Pong 👍

It helps to ensure that the connection between the client and server remains open and responsive.


### Fragmentation ⚠️

WebSocket provides a frame-based message protocol to transfer data.

For large data, A message can be split into multiple smaller fragment, So an endpoint
don't have to buffer entire message.

Unfortunately, there is currently no browser support for handling or sending fragmented messages.
So it's a useless feature.


### Mask 👎

The idea behind masking is that, client may send well crafted http message which 
might exploit weaknesses of caching mechanisms of proxies. [See section 10.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455#section-10.3).

In [section 5.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455#section-5.1):

> "A client MUST mask all frames that it sends to the server."

In short, Masking is an expensive process. And not all application suffer from cache poisoning.
For this reason many server implementations allow unmasked data.

In this context masking is unnecessary. But browser must honor websocket specification.
So there is always some unnecessary performance overhead, when receiving data from the client.

- Solutions:

Websocket should allow unmasked frame.


### [Poor algoridom](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455#section-5.2) for encoding length 👎

If length is less then 125, it take 7 only bits space, But for larger number (`u16` or `u64`) it cost 7 bits! 

`u64` can support data up to `16384` petabytes in byte length! But the server only allows data up to `64` MB.


- Solutions: 

Websocket should use better algoridoms, For example: [LEB128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEB128) or [QUIC Variable-Length Integer Encoding](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html#name-variable-length-integer-enc)


### Poor WebSocket API 👎

WebSocket API uses the old-fashioned callback, And doesn't support [backpressure](https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/#backpressure)

- Solutions:

Here is an echo example with better API. 

```typescript
let ws = await WebSocket.connect('ws://example.com');
console.log("Socket opened!");

for await (let msg of ws.recv()) {
    ws.send(msg.data);
}

ws.closed.then(() => {
    console.log("Socket closed!");
});
```

## Alternative protocols

Websocket connection is expensive (`TCP + TLS + HTTP upgrade`), So Websockets should be used as long-lived connection. 

To make better use of long-term connections, some sort of multiplex mechanism is required.

Why not HTTP/2 ?

- It support multiplex!
- Use single long-lived TCP connection!

Although It has some http overhead.

For non-browser application, Use raw TCP!
